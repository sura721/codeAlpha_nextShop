Product	id, name, description, price, images[], category, inStock, stockCount
Order	id, userId (relation), totalPrice, status (PENDING, PROCESSING, SHIPPED, DELIVERED, CANCELED), shippingAddress, timestamps
OrderItem	id, orderId, productId, quantity


npx prisma db push

Use NextAuth.js

Set up:

Credentials Provider (email/password + bcrypt)

OAuth Provider (Google, GitHub)

Include user id & role in session for authorization
